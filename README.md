# cargo-bavy [![Crates.io](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/cargo-bavy.svg)](https://crates.io/crates/cargo-bavy) [![license: MIT/Apache-2.0](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT%2FApache--2.0-blue.svg)](https://github.com/TimJentzsch/cargo-bavy/#license)

A third-party command-line utility for the [Bevy game engine](https://bevyengine.org/).

To not steal the `cargo bevy` command from the official Bevy maintainers, I chose `cargo bavy` instead.

## Installation

```cli
cargo install cargo-bavy
```

## Usage

### Creating a new Bevy app

Run the following command:

```cli
cargo bavy new <FOLDER_NAME>
```

You can then select all the features that you want.
Afterwards, a template project with the given name is created for you.
